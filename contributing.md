# Contributing

## Before you contribute

### File an issue first!

If you see a bug or have an idea for a feature that you feel would improve the repo, **please
[file an issue](https://github.com/srihariash999/whatnext_app/issues/new) before you begin
coding or send a PR**. This will help prevent duplicate work by letting us know
what you're up to. It will help avoid a situation in which you spend a lot of
time coding something that's not quite right for the repo or its goals.

## Issue Submission Guidelines

Before you submit your issue search the archive, maybe your question was already answered.

If your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue. Help us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new features, by not reporting duplicate issues.

The "new issue" form contains a number of prompts that you should fill out to make it easier to understand and categorize the issue.


## Pull Request Submission Guidelines

Before you submit your pull request consider the following guidelines:

- First check whether there is an open Issue for what you will be working on. If there is not, open one up by going through issue submission guidelines.
- Search for an open or closed Pull Request that relates to your submission. You don't want to duplicate effort.
- Make your changes in a new git branch:

  ```text
    git checkout -b name-issue-tracker-short-description
  ```

  Name can be initials or GitHub username. An example of this could be:

  ```text
    git checkout -b joshsmith-issue-75-screen-overflow-fix master
  ```

## Git Commit Guidelines

Write meaningful commit messages. This will help understand your contribution better.



**Lastly, be nice to other people and help them out however you can.**
